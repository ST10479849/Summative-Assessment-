The code just beneath the four parallel arrays. The button to go to the next screen is the first button of the code. Then it is followed by declared variables of the text view and the exit button and add button. I added a function for the sentence to be displayed to the user. Following that we have the add button with a function inside and the exit button.

This is the user interface i added a music note image. My three buttons one to display the sentence of entering details another to exit the app and the last one to go to the detailed view screen which i named the ViewDetails screen.
